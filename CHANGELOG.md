### Changed

- Respect Unicode identifiers in
  [name sanitization](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree#name-sanitization).
  If you only use ASCII file paths, then this change has no effect. Essentially,
  non-ASCII characters that are valid in identifiers (from Rust 1.53.0) are
  preserved instead of replaced by an underscore `"_"`.

### Fixed

- Fix portability of generated relative paths by always separating components
  with a slash `/`, even on platforms that natively use a backslash `\` instead.

## [0.1.1] - 2021-05-14

### Fixed

- Activate traits for `syn::Path` missing during build of test project.

## [0.1.0] - 2021-05-14

Initial development release.
